## Introduction
My name is Calvin Kimani, a passionate second-year Computer Technology(B.Tech) student at the Technical University of Kenya. Delving into the realms of pwn, binary exploitation, mitigation, and binary research, I have embarked on a thrilling journey where I embrace challenges, push boundaries, and constantly strive to think differently.

## Embracing the Love for Hard Things
From an early age, I developed a fondness for tackling the difficult and unconventional. I have an innate curiosity that drives me towards complex problems that others may shy away from. It was this love for the hard things in life that led me to programming, where I discovered a world of infinite possibilities and a playground for my inquisitive mind.

## The Fascination with Assembly and C
While some may shy away from languages like assembly and C due to their inherent complexities, I found myself irresistibly drawn to them. Initially, I even convinced myself that I hated C, but curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to learn it. To my surprise, I fell in love with the power, elegance, and sheer control that these languages provide. Programming in assembly and C pushes me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to grow and think beyond conventional boundaries.

## CSRP, Project Apollo
I'm the proud founder of CSRP (Cyberlabs Security Research Project), an organization devoted to cybersecurity research. CSRP serves as a platform for passionate individuals to collaborate, learn, and contribute to the world of binary security. In addition, there's also Project Apollo, a remarkable web-based tool designed for searching CVEs. Soon, the project will expand to encompass exploits and vulnerabilities.

## Team ACT48 and CTF Competitions
Founder and captain of Team ACT48 (Advanced Computer Threat Unit 48), I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. These thrilling events enable me to apply my skills, collaborate with teammates, and overcome intricate challenges. The camaraderie and synergy within the team drive us to new heights, fostering an environment of continuous growth and learning.

## Exploring the Depths of Pwn and Binary Security
My passion lies in exploring the intricate vulnerabilities that lie within the realm of pwn. While I don't have a specific area of specialization, I immerse myself in understanding various vulnerabilities and developing novel techniques to exploit them. The ever-evolving landscape of pwn inspires me to adapt, learn, and uncover creative approaches to outsmart security measures. The thrill of solving complex puzzles and the satisfaction of outsmarting a system fuel my desire to continuously dive deeper into this fascinating world.

## The Quest for Knowledge and Greatness
I am driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, constantly seeking to expand my understanding of computer systems and their vulnerabilities. My ultimate ambition is to become a trailblazer, leaving an indelible mark on the world of pwn and binary security. With a burning desire to unravel the mysteries of software systems, I yearn to achieve greatness and push the boundaries of what is possible.

## Staying at the Cutting Edge
Remaining at the forefront of technological advancements and emerging trends is vital in this dynamic field. To stay updated, I immerse myself in a plethora of resources, including research papers, journals, videos, and related projects. By keeping my finger on the pulse of the latest developments, I strive to continually refine my expertise and insights.
